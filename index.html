        <p id="pragraph">Dilip Kumar (1922-2021) is widely considered
            the greatest acting exponent India ever produced.
            Born Muhammad Yusuf Khan on December 11, 1922,
            in Qissa Khwani Bazaar, Peshawar, British India
            (present-day Pakistan), he is better known by his stage name Dilip Kumar given to him by actress and owner
            of Bombay Talkies, Devika Rani. Credited with pioneering method acting in Indian cinema in mid-1940s, before
            Marlon Brando introduced it to Hollywood in 1950s, he has been often called as "Abhinay Samrat" (Hindi for
            "Emperor of Acting")
